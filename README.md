A) Once we used the design patterns, things got tidier and simpler to handle. Clearer menus popped up thanks to tabs, making it smoother to move around. Need quick stuff? Quick Actions plus hotkeys get you there fast - no hassle. Status lights show what’s going on at a glance, while fresh additions stay visible right away. All this means less thinking, quicker moves, and feeling sure about your work when tracking stock.
B) I added quick actions,  keyboard shortcuts, recently added, and need help. Everything I added follows the 5 design patterns, which are navigation, input & forms, feedback & status, layout & structure, and data presentation. It fits my feature because it helps users navigate easier around the webpage. It solves the HCI problem of not being able to find what you are looking for because everything is sorted in a card layout with its labels and icons. It helps users have a more pleasant experience browsing this webpage.
